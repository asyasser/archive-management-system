Follow this guide to run the application in your machine : 

inside the backend and frontend folders you will find the requirements.txt file for each (Frontend & Backend) containing all the dependencies needed to get the project up running.

backend : 
	* FastAPI
	* uvicorn
	* sqlalchemy
	* psycopg2-binary
	* python-dotenv
	* qrcode[pil]
	* reportlab
Frontend :
	* axios
	* html5-qrcode
    * lucide-react
	* react
    * react-dom
	* react-router-dom
	* tailwindcss

==========Installing the dependencies===============

==> After cloning the github repository, head to the backend folder :

	1- Create a virtual enviroment : python -m venv venv
	2- Activate it : source venv/bin/activate
	3- After that, install the requirements provided in the requirements.txt file (using the command pip install )
or : pip install -r requirements.txt

==> setup the database : install postgresql and start it, then open pgAdmin4 and create a database without tables (because when you run the code the backend will create the table implicitly). after that create your own .env file and create a variable called "DATABASE_URL" and assign your database URL to it. 
	- example for the database url : DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
change the user and password to your own names.


==> Now go to the frontend folder in your terminal and run the command : "npm install" to install the frontend dependencies.

=========Run the project================

1. backend : 
	- in the terminal head to backend/app : and run the command : "uvicorn main:app --reload" --> this will run the backend on port 8000
2. Frontend : 
	- in the terminal head to frontend/ and run the command : npm run dev
and the frontend will be running on port 5173.
